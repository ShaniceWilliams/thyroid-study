# Predicting Thyroid Cancer Recurrence

## Things to explore when moving into model building
- Which will be the most performant features?
- Do we need all the features or will models perform better with fewer features?
- Which feature selection method will result in the best model performance?
- What impact does oversampling vs no oversampling vs Smote have on model performance? 
    - In particular, will this result in being able to minimise false negatives (type II errors)?
